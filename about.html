      <h2> Who is Ralston Fitler?</h2>
      <p>I am a Creative Thinker and Problem Solver. My design process is simple: Discover, Define, Design and then Develop. I love to draw and sketch out ideas and solutions on whiteboards or anything I can get my hands on to help share my UX concept or design solution.</p>
   <div class="extra"> <h2>Making a UX Designer</h2>
    <p>When I started high school, I signed up for a web design class. The first day in the class I knew I wanted to do something with designing a digital space. Designing a website felt like something out of a Si-Fi movie, the ability to type in HTML and CSS in order to change the look and information on a webpage blew my mind. Naturally, I wanted to learn at an accelerated pace, so I would spend my free time learning how to add and change certain elements of a webpage. This ranged from changing the background color all the way to how to make my webpage responsive.</p>
    <p>As I was approaching college, I found a major called Interactive Design. This was a fusion between user experience and user interface design, with the knowledge and foundation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During my time in this major, I fell in love with UX Design. I started to see more and more flaws with everyday apps I used and websites I would scroll through. I became conscious of the laws and principles in place that these apps and websites were breaking. Once I graduated I was about to instill UX processes into the companies where I worked. I introduced 22Miles to an lean UX process and how to effectively help our clients get a project that would look beautiful, and ensure the end-user could navigate it with ease. At Queer Global I was able to flush out and start user interviews. Learning about my users allows me to design for them, as well as empathize with them</p>
